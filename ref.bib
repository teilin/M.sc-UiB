After giving a short introduction to the area, we consider several ways in which models may be used to optimise maintenance, such as case studies, operational and strategic decision support systems, and give examples of each of them. Next we discuss several areas where the models have been applied successfully. These include civil structure and aeroplane maintenance. From a comparative point of view, we discuss future prospects.}

abstract = {The technical report presents a generic exact solution approach for minimizing the project duration of the resource-constrained project scheduling problem with generalized precedences (Rcpsp/max). The approach uses lazy clause generation, i.e., a hybrid of finite domain and Boolean satisfiability solving, in order to apply nogood learning and conflict-driven search on the solution generation. Our experi- ments show the benefit of lazy clause generation for finding an optimal solutions and proving its optimality in comparison to other state-of-the-art exact and non-exact methods. The method is highly robust: it matched or bettered the best known results on all of the 2340 instances we examined except 3, according to the currently available data on the PSPLib. Of the 631 open instances in this set it closed 573 and improved the bounds of 51 of the remaining 58 instances.}

We restrict ourselves to basic problems: the processing times are fixed, there are neither set-up times nor due dates nor release dates, etc. Then, the objective is the minimization of the makespan."

All jobs require one time unit.
(2)
All jobs require one or two time units, and there are only two processor resolving (in the negative a conjecture of R. L. Graham, Proc. SJCC, 1972, pp. 205–218).


As a consequence, the general preemptive scheduling problem is also NP-complete.

These results are tantamount to showing that the scheduling problems mentioned are intractable."

     abstract = {Algorithms are developed for solving problems to minimize the length of production schedules. The algorithms generate any one, or all, schedule(s) of a particular subset of all possible schedules, called the active schedules. This subset contains, in turn, a subset of the optimal schedules. It is further shown that every optimal schedule is equivalent to an active optimal schedule. Computational experience with the algorithms shows that it is practical, in problems of small size, to generate the complete set of all active schedules and to pick the optimal schedules directly from this set and, when this is not practical, to random sample from the set of all active schedules and, thus, to produce schedules that are optimal with a probability as close to unity as is desired. The basic algorithm can also generate the particular schedules produced by well-known machine loading rules.},
