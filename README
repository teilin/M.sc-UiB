<h1>ABSTRACT</h1>

This master thesis is about extending a constraint programing (CP) problem. The problem is a schuduling problem in the
oil industry, where it has a number of constraints, like activityies, cranes, crews and so on. To get the makespan minimized
the problem also has to satisfy some security constraints.

To solve this problem, the IBM ILOG CP is used. That is a C++ libary that include CPSolver, CPModel and Concert.
